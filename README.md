# User Info Fetcher

A simple web app that fetches user data from a public API and allows you to add new users locally.

## Features
- Fetches user data from [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users)
- Displays user name, email, and address
- Shows a loading animation while fetching data
- Handles network errors gracefully
- Allows adding new users via a form
- Persists added users using localStorage (they remain after reload)
- Reload button to refetch API data

## Getting Started
